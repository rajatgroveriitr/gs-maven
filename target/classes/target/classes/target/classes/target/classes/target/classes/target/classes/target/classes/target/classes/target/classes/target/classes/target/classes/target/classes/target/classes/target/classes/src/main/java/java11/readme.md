# Java SE 11 was released on September, 25th 2018 
Oracle has changed the licensing and support model which means if you download the Java 11 Oracle JDK, it will be paid for commercial use.
No need to pay unless you download the Oracle JDK and use it in production.

Java 10 was the last free Oracle JDK that could be downloaded.

While Oracle JDK is no longer free, you can always download the Open JDK builds from Oracle or other providers such as AdoptOpenJDK, Azul, IBM, Red Hat, etc.

### Running Java File with single command
One major change is that you donâ€™t need to compile the java source file with `javac` tool first. 
You can directly run the file with `java` command and it implicitly compiles.
